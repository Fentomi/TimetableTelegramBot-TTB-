# TimetableTelegramBot-TTB-
My first synchronized telegram bot in python

# About the project:
- #### _This is my first project whose seriousness went beyond primitive python programming tutorials and which was created to realize my personal goals. I wanted to create a parser bot that would automatically send me a message at certain intervals about the schedule at the institute._
- #### _Later I created a second version of this bot when I learned about the existence of asynchronous libraries for creating telegram bots. The second bot you can also simply find in my repositories, it just got the postfix 2.0v._
- #### _With these two bots I spoke at a conference inside my institute, where I talked about the difference between synchronous and asynchronous processes and bots in particular._

# Project background:
*In the fall of 2023, I entered the institute as a programmer, and the institute had its own website where I needed to look at class schedules. From time to time the site went to bed and the site became inaccessible to get information about the schedule. In my head I had an idea of such a bot, which would not only parse information from the site, but also from time to time write the institute site into its file, so that I always had access to the information.*
