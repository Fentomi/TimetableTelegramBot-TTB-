# TimetableTelegramBot-TTB-
My first synchronized telegram bot in python

# About the project:
- #### _This is my first project whose seriousness went beyond primitive python programming tutorials and which was created to realize my personal goals. I wanted to create a parser bot that would automatically send me a message at certain intervals about the schedule at the institute._
- #### _Later I created a second version of this bot when I learned about the existence of asynchronous libraries for creating telegram bots. The second bot you can also simply find in my repositories, it just got the postfix 2.0v._
- #### _With these two bots I spoke at a conference inside my institute, where I talked about the difference between synchronous and asynchronous processes and bots in particular._
